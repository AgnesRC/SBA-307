Github Repository Link: https://github.com/AgnesRC/SBA-307.git

This project is a simple three-paged website for a scholarship fund, that gives interested individuals information about the scholarship on the first page and an option to apply. When interested individuals click to apply (either in the nav bar or "our scholarships' section), they are taken to page two where they can apply for the scholarship. When applicants submit their application, they receive a confirmation of submission on the third page with next steps in the process.
